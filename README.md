## Why This Matters

Every second counts. Every number in this visualization represents a sentient being that lost their life. By making these statistics visible and immediate, we hope to create meaningful conversations about animal rights and veganism.

Use this tool in your activism to show the scale of animal exploitation and inspire change.
